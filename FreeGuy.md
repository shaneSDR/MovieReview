Movie: Free Guy</br>
Review: A classic fun and care-free movie for the summer. Free Guy depicts the life of an in-game character that learns his world is not at all as it seems. But the story doesn't matter here. Enjoy the movie for the humor and graphic effects; preferrably with the adult beverage of your choice!</br>
